            <h1>Worker Animate</h1>
            <p>
                Animation driven by requestAnimationFrame in worker. Each frame a "block" of objects is created. Each
                block is retained until the max is reached then the oldest is removed.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Firefox (as of 121.0.1) there's a noticeable stutter when the GC runs in the worker taking enough
                time that it affects the requestAnimationFrame duration.
